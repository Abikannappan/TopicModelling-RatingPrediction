    "To do Topic modeling and Rating Prediction(Basic Sentiment Analysis) to bring out the topics discussed in Amazon Refrigerator Water Filter reviews and their sentiments. This project will be helpful for Product development department to understand more about a product based on customer's review. They can use those ideas to further develop their product."
